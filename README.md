# covid_Graphs4Good

In this repo, I store all the notebooks and script about the Covid data analysis proposed by Kaggle \(see [CORD-19 NLP Challenge]https://www.kaggle.com/covid19)\)

My first idea was to build a search engine using Neo4j. This idea was originally thought for a search engine for arxiv papers but due to the recent events and the Kaggle's challange I decided to change my plans.
The data used in this first part are in metadata.csv file [here](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).

On kaggle competition page there are already a lot of interesting kernels which are really good to know and learn.
